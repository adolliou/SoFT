# HelioTrak: A Feature Tracking Suite for Solar Physics

Small-scale magnetic elements are vital in the energetic balance of the Sunâ€™s atmosphere. These structures cover the entire solar surface and understanding their dynamics can address longstanding questions such as coronal heating and solar wind acceleration.

While existing tracking codes are accessible, they often use outdated or licensed programming languages. **HelioTrak** is a novel feature tracking routine built in Python, designed for reliable detection and fast associations.

### Detection and Identification: The Watershed Algorithm

The detection phase in HelioTrak involves:

1. **Threshold Masking**: Mask out pixels below a given threshold to reduce noise.
2. **Local Maxima Detection**: Identify peaks separated by a user-defined minimum distance.
3. **Euclidean Distance Transform (EDT)**: Compute the shortest distance from each non-zero pixel to the background.
4. **Watershed Segmentation**: Use local maxima as markers and segment the image based on the EDT gradient field.

### Association

Features are matched across frames:

1. **Forward Check**: Examine the overlap between feature M in frame n (M(n)) and all features in frame n+1 occupying the same pixels.
2. **Backward Check**: Verify the overlap between feature M in frame n+1 and features in frame n.
3. **Matching**: If M(n) and M(n+1) select each other, they are successfully matched.

To enable parallel processing, frames are paired and condensed into cubes. This reverse bisection condensation continues iteratively until one cube remains with all features properly associated.

### Tabulation

After association, the physical properties of magnetic structures are estimated and compiled:

- **Barycenters**: Calculated by averaging pixel coordinates weighted by intensity for sub-pixel accuracy.
- **Area**: Determined by counting pixels within the feature's contour.
- **Magnetic Flux**: Summed from pixel intensities.
- **Velocity**: Derived from the first-order derivative of barycenter positions.
